# salaryClassification

## About This Project
This project was a classification project I built with a dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to use Sklearn and XGBoost to predict whether an individual made over $50k/year based on a variety of features including race, location, and age among other.

I implemented the following classification algorithms:
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- XGBoost


### Built With
- Sklearn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Xgboost
